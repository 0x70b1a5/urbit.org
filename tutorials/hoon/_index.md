This section contains material for learning Hoon. For newbies, we recommend
going through the [Hoon School](@/docs/tutorials/hoon/hoon-school/_index.md)
series, and consider enrolling in Hooniversity, a regularly held community-run
course which follows along the Hoon School curriculum and may be found at [Hooniversity](https://hooniversity.org/).

The other tutorials found in this section are also valuable material for
learning Hoon, but are not a part of the linearly organized Hoon school path.
