This section will be reference documentation for the data types used by our
filesystem. It is up to date as of March 2021.

As a general guide, we recommend reading and attempting to understand the data
structures used in any Hoon code before you try to read the code itself.
Although complete understanding of the data structures is impossible without
seeing them used in the code, an 80% understanding greatly clarifies the code.
As another general guide, when reading Hoon, it rarely pays off to understand
every line of code when it appears. Try to get the gist of it, and then move on.
The next time you come back to it, it'll likely make a lot more sense.

### Data Models

As you're reading through this section, remember you can always come
back to this when you run into these types later on. You're not going to
remember everything the first time through, but it is worth reading, or
at least skimming, this so that you get a rough idea of how our state is
organized.

The types that are certainly worth reading are `++raft`, `++room`,
`++dome:clay`, `++ankh:clay`, `++rung:clay`, `++rang:clay`, `++blob:clay`,
`++yaki:clay`, and `++nori:clay` (possibly in that order). All in all, though,
this section isn't too long, so many readers may wish to quickly read through
all of it. If you get bored, though, just skip to the next section. You can
always come back when you need to.

### `$raft`, formal state

```hoon
+$  raft                                                ::  filesystem
  $:  rom=room                                          ::  domestic
      hoy=(map ship rung)                               ::  foreign
      ran=rang                                          ::  hashes
      mon=(map term beam)                               ::  mount points
      hez=(unit duct)                                   ::  sync duct
      cez=(map @ta crew)                                ::  permission groups
      pud=(unit [=desk =yoki])                          ::  pending update
  ==                                                    ::
```

This is the state of the vane. Anything that must be remembered between
calls to Clay is stored in this state.

`ran` is the store of all commits and deltas, keyed by hash. The is
where all the "real" data we know is stored; the rest is "just
bookkeeping".

`rom` is the state for all local desks. It consists of a `duct` to
[Dill](@/docs/arvo/dill/dill.md) and a collection of `desk`s.

`hoy` is the state for all foreign desks.

`ran` is the global, hash-addressed object store. It has maps of commit hashes
to commits and content hashes to content.

`mon` is a collection of Unix mount points. `term` is the mount point (relative
to th pier) and `beam` is a domestic Clay directory.

`hez` is the duct used to sync with Unix.

`cez` is a collection of named permission groups.

`pud` is an update that's waiting on a kernel upgrade.


#### `$room`, filesystem per domestic ship

```hoon
+$  room                                                ::  fs per ship
          $:  hun=duct                                  ::  terminal duct
              dos=(map desk dojo)                       ::  native desk
          ==                                            ::
```

This is the representation of the filesystem of a ship on our pier.

`hun` is the duct we use to send messages to [Dill](@/docs/arvo/dill/dill.md) to
display notifications of filesystem changes. Only `%note` `%gift`s should be
produced along this `duct`. This is set by the `%init` `move`.

`dos` is a well-known operating system released in 1981. It is also the
set of `desk`s on this ship, mapped to their `desk` state.

#### `$desk`, filesystem branch

```hoon
+$  desk  @tas
```

This is the name of a branch of the filesystem. The default `desk`s are `%home`
and `%kids`. More may be created by simply referencing them. `desk`s have
independent histories and states, and they may be
[merged](@/docs/arvo/clay/using.md#merging) into each other.

### `$dojo`, domestic desk state

```hoon
+$  dojo
  $:  qyx=cult                                          ::  subscribers
      dom=dome                                          ::  desk state
      per=regs                                          ::  read perms per path
      pew=regs                                          ::  write perms per path
  ==
```

This is the all the data that is specific to a particular `desk` on a domestic
ship. `qyx` is the set of subscribers to this `desk`, and `dom` is the data in
the `desk`. `regs` are `(map path rule)`, and so `per` is a `map` of read
permissions by `path` and `pew` is a `map` of write permissions by `path`.

#### `$cult`, subscriptions

```hoon
+$  cult  (jug wove duct)
```

`cult`s keep track of subscribers. `wove`s are associated to requests, and each
`wove` is mapped to a set of `duct`s associated to subscribers who should be
notified when the request is filled/updated.

#### `$rave:clay`, general subscription request

```hoon
    ++  rave                                                ::  general request
              $%  [& p=mood]                                ::  single request
                  [| p=moat]                                ::  change range
              ==                                            ::
```

```hoon
  +$  rave                                              ::  general request
    $%  [%sing =mood]                                   ::  single request
        [%next =mood]                                   ::  await next version
        [%mult =mool]                                   ::  next version of any
        [%many track=? =moat]                           ::  track range
    ==                                                  ::
```

This represents a subscription request for a `desk`.

A `%sing` request asks for data at single revision.

A `%next` request asks to be notified the next time thereâ€™s a change to the
specified file.

A `%mult` request asks to be notified the next time there's a change to a
specified set of files.

A `%many` request asks to be notified on every change in a `desk` for a range of changes (including into the future).

### `++rove`, stored general subscription request

```hoon
    ++  rove  (each mood moot)                              ::  stored request
```

When we store a request, we store subscriptions with a little extra
information so that we can determine whether new versions actually
affect the path we're subscribed to.

#### `++mood:clay`, single subscription request

```hoon
    ++  mood  ,[p=care q=case r=path]                       ::  request in desk
```

This represents a request for the state of the desk at a particular
commit, specfied by `q`. `p` specifies what kind of information is
desired, and `r` specifies the path we are requesting.

#### `++moat:clay`, range subscription request

```hoon
    ++  moat  ,[p=case q=case r=path]                       ::  change range
```

This represents a request for all changes between `p` and `q` on path
`r`. You will be notified when a change is made to the node referenced
by the path or to any of its children.

### `++moot`, stored range subscription request

```hoon
    ++  moot  ,[p=case q=case r=path s=(map path lobe)]     ::
```

This is just a `++moat:clay` plus a map of paths to lobes. This map
represents the data at the node referenced by the path at case `p`, if
we've gotten to that case (else null). We only send a notification along
the subscription if the data at a new revision is different than it was.

### `++care:clay`, Clay submode

```hoon
    ++  care  ?(%u %v %w %x %y %z)                          ::  Clay submode
```

This specifies what type of information is requested in a subscription
or a scry.

`%u` requests the `++rang:clay` at the current moment. Because this
information is not stored for any moment other than the present, we
crash if the `++case:clay` is not a `%da` for now.

`%v` requests the `++dome:clay` at the specified commit.

`%w` requests the revsion number of the desk.

`%x` requests the file at a specified path at the specified commit. If
there is no node at that path or if the node has no contents (that is,
if `q:ankh` is null), then this produces null.

`%y` requests a `++arch` of the specfied commit at the specified path.

`%z` requests the `++ankh` of the specified commit at the specfied path.

### `++arch`, shallow filesystem node

```hoon
    ++  arch  ,[p=@uvI q=(unit ,@uvI) r=(map ,@ta ,~)]      ::  fundamental node
```

This is analogous to `++ankh:clay` except that the we have neither our
contents nor the ankhs of our children. The other fields are exactly the
same, so `p` is a hash of the associated ankh, `u.q`, if it exists, is a
hash of the contents of this node, and the keys of `r` are the names of
our children. `r` is a map to null rather than a set so that the
ordering of the map will be equivalent to that of `r:ankh`, allowing
efficient conversion.

#### `++case:clay`, specifying a commit

```hoon
    ++  case                                                ::  ship desk case spur
              $%  [%da p=@da]                               ::  date
                  [%tas p=@tas]                             ::  label
                  [%ud p=@ud]                               ::  number
              ==                                            ::
```

A commit can be referred to in three ways: `%da` refers to the commit
that was at the head on date `p`, `%tas` refers to the commit labeled
`p`, and `%ud` refers to the commit numbered `p`. Note that since these
all can be reduced down to a `%ud`, only numbered commits may be
referenced with a `++case:clay`.

#### `++dome:clay`, desk data

```hoon
    ++  dome                                                ::  project state
              $:  ang=agon                                  ::  pedigree
                  ank=ankh                                  ::  state
                  let=@ud                                   ::  top id
                  hit=(map ,@ud tako)                       ::  changes by id
                  lab=(map ,@tas ,@ud)                      ::  labels
              ==                                            ::
```

This is the data that is actually stored in a desk.

`ang` is unused and should be removed.

`ank` is the current state of the desk. Thus, it is the state of the
filesystem at revison `let`. The head of a desk is always a numbered
commit.

`let` is the number of the most recently numbered commit. This is also
the total number of numbered commits.

`hit` is a map of numerical ids to hashes of commits. These hashes are
mapped into their associated commits in `hut:rang:clay`. In general, the keys
of this map are exactly the numbers from 1 to `let`, with no gaps. Of
course, when there are no numbered commits, `let` is 0, so `hit` is
null. Additionally, each of the commits is an ancestor of every commit
numbered greater than this one. Thus, each is a descendant of every
commit numbered less than this one. Since it is true that the date in
each commit (`t:yaki`) is no earlier than that of each of its parents,
the numbered commits are totally ordered in the same way by both
pedigree and date. Of course, not every commit is numbered. If that
sounds too complicated to you, don't worry about it. It basically
behaves exactly as you would expect.

`lab` is a map of textual labels to numbered commits. Note that labels
can only be applied to numbered commits. Labels must be unique across a
desk.

#### `++ankh`, filesystem node

```hoon
    ++  ankh                                                ::  fs node (new)
              $:  p=cash                                    ::  recursive hash
                  q=(unit ,[p=cash q=*])                    ::  file
                  r=(map ,@ta ankh)                         ::  folders
              ==                                            ::
```

This is a single node in the filesystem. This may be file or a directory
or both. In earth filesystems, a node is a file xor a directory. On
mars, we're inclusive, so a node is a file ior a directory.

`p` is a recursive hash that depends on the contents of the this file or
directory and on any children.

`q` is the contents of this file, if any. `p.q` is a hash of the
contents while `q.q` is the data itself.

`r` is the set of children of this node. In the case of a pure file,
this is empty. The keys are the names of the children and the values
are, recursively, the nodes themselves.

#### `++cash`, ankh hash

```hoon
    ++  cash  ,@uvH                                         ::  ankh hash
```

This is a 128-bit hash of an ankh. These are mostly stored within ankhs
themselves, and they are used to check for changes in possibly-deep
hierarchies.

#### `++rung`, filesystem per neighbor ship

```hoon
    ++  rung  $:  rus=(map desk rede)                       ::  neighbor desks
              ==                                            ::
```

This is the filesystem of a neighbor ship. The keys to this map are all
the desks we know about on their ship.

#### `++rede`, desk state

```hoon
    ++  rede                                                ::  universal project
              $:  lim=@da                                   ::  complete to
                  qyx=cult                                  ::  subscribers
                  ref=(unit rind)                           ::  outgoing requests
                  dom=dome                                  ::  revision state
              ==                                            ::
```

This is our knowledge of the state of a desk, either foreign or
domestic.

`lim` is the date of the last full update. We only respond to requests
for stuff before this time.

`qyx` is the list of subscribers to this desk. For domestic desks, this
is simply `p:dojo`, all subscribers to the desk, while in foreign desks
this is all the subscribers from our ship to the foreign desk.

`ref` is the request manager for the desk. For domestic desks, this is
null since we handle requests ourselves.

`dom` is the actual data in the desk.

#### `++rind`, request manager

```hoon
    ++  rind                                                ::  request manager
              $:  nix=@ud                                   ::  request index
                  bom=(map ,@ud ,[p=duct q=rave])           ::  outstanding
                  fod=(map duct ,@ud)                       ::  current requests
                  haw=(map mood (unit))                     ::  simple cache
              ==                                            ::
```

This is the request manager for a foreign desk.

`nix` is one more than the index of the most recent request. Thus, it is
the next available request number.

`bom` is the set of outstanding requests. The keys of this map are some
subset of the numbers between 0 and one less than `nix`. The members of
the map are exactly those requests that have not yet been fully
satisfied.

`fod` is the same set as `bom`, but from a different perspective. In
particular, the values of `fod` are the same as the values of `bom`, and
the `p` out of the values of `bom` are the same as the keys of `fod`.
Thus, we can map ducts to their associated request number and `++rave:clay`,
and we can map numbers to their associated duct and `++rave:clay`.

`haw` is a map from simple requests to their values. This acts as a
cache for requests that have already been made. Thus, the second request
for a particular `++mood:clay` is nearly instantaneous.

#### `++rang:clay`, data store

```hoon
    ++  rang  $:  hut=(map tako yaki)                       ::
                  lat=(map lobe blob)                       ::
              ==                                            ::
```

This is a set of data keyed by hash. Thus, this is where the "real" data
is stored, but it is only meaningful if we know the hash of what we're
looking for.

`hut` is a map from hashes to commits. We often get the hashes from
`hit:dome:clay`, which keys them by logical id. Not every commit has an id.

`lat` is a map from hashes to the actual data. We often get the hashes
from a `++yaki`, a commit, which references this map to get the data.
There is no `++blob:clay` in any `++yaki:clay`. They are only accessible through
this map.

#### `++tako:clay`, commit reference

```hoon
    ++  tako  ,@                                            ::  yaki ref
```

This is a hash of a `++yaki:clay`, a commit. These are most notably used as
the keys in `hut:rang:clay`, where they are associated with the actual
`++yaki:clay`, and as the values in `hit:dome:clay`, where sequential ids are
associated with these.

#### `++yaki:clay`, commit

```hoon
    ++  yaki  ,[p=(list tako) q=(map path lobe) r=tako t=@da] ::  commit
```

This is a single commit.

`p` is a list of the hashes of the parents of this commit. In most
cases, this will be a single commit, but in a merge there may be more
parents. In theory, there may be an arbitrary number of parents, but in
practice merges have exactly two parents. This may change in the future.
For commit 1, there is no parent.

`q` is a map of the paths on a desk to the data at that location. If you
understand what a `++lobe:clay` and a `++blob:clay` is, then the type signature
here tells the whole story.

`r` is the hash associated with this commit.

`t` is the date at which this commit was made.

#### `++lobe:clay`, data reference

```hoon
    ++  lobe  ,@                                            ::  blob ref
```

This is a hash of a `++blob:clay`. These are most notably used in `lat:rang:clay`,
where they are associated with the actual `++blob:clay`, and as the values in
`q:yaki:clay`, where paths are associated with their data in a commit.

#### `++blob:clay`, data

```hoon
    ++  blob  $%  [%delta p=lobe q=lobe r=udon]             ::  delta on q
                  [%direct p=lobe q=* r=umph]               ::
                  [%indirect p=lobe q=* r=udon s=lobe]      ::
              ==                                            ::
```

This is a node of data. In every case, `p` is the hash of the blob.

`%delta` is the case where we define the data by a delta on other data.
In practice, the other data is always the previous commit, but nothing
depends on this. `q` is the hash of the parent blob, and `r` is the
delta.

`%direct` is the case where we simply have the data directly. `q` is the
data itself, and `r` is any preprocessing instructions. These almost
always come from the creation of a file.

`%indirect` is both of the preceding cases at once. `q` is the direct
data, `r` is the delta, and `s` is the parent blob. It should always be
the case that applying `r` to `s` gives the same data as `q` directly
(with the prepreprocessor instructions in `p.r`). This exists purely for
performance reasons. This is unused, at the moment, but in general these
should be created when there are a long line of changes so that we do
not have to traverse the delta chain back to the creation of the file.

#### `++udon`, abstract delta

```hoon
    ++  udon                                                ::  abstract delta
              $:  p=umph                                    ::  preprocessor
                  $=  q                                     ::  patch
                  $%  [%a p=* q=*]                          ::  trivial replace
                      [%b p=udal]                           ::  atomic indel
                      [%c p=(urge)]                         ::  list indel
                      [%d p=upas q=upas]                    ::  tree edit
                  ==                                        ::
              ==                                            ::
```

This is an abstract change to a file. This is a superset of what would
normally be called diffs. Diffs usually refer to changes in lines of
text while we have the ability to do more interesting deltas on
arbitrary data structures.

`p` is any preprocessor instructions.

`%a` refers to the trival delta of a complete replace of old data with
new data.

`%b` refers to changes in an opaque atom on the block level. This has
very limited usefulness, and is not used at the moment.

`%c` refers to changes in a list of data. This is often lines of text,
which is your classic diff. We, however, will work on any list of data.

`%d` refers to changes in a tree of data. This is general enough to
describe changes to any hoon [noun](/docs/glossary/noun/), but often more special-purpose delta
should be created for different content types. This is not used at the
moment, and may in fact be unimplemented.

#### `++urge`, list change

```hoon
    ++  urge  |*(a=_,* (list (unce a)))                     ::  list change
```

This is a parametrized type for list changes. For example, `(urge ,@t)`
is a list change for lines of text.

#### `++unce`, change part of a list.

```hoon
    ++  unce  |*  a=_,*                                     ::  change part
              $%  [%& p=@ud]                                ::  skip[copy]
                  [%| p=(list a) q=(list a)]                ::  p -> q[chunk]
              ==                                            ::
```

This is a single change in a list of elements of type `a`. For example,
`(unce ,@t)` is a single change in a lines of text.

`%&` means the next `p` lines are unchanged.

`%|` means the lines `p` have changed to `q`.

#### `++umph`, preprocessing information

```hoon
    ++  umph                                                ::  change filter
              $|  $?  %a                                    ::  no filter
                      %b                                    ::  jamfile
                      %c                                    ::  LF text
                  ==                                        ::
              $%  [%d p=@ud]                                ::  blocklist
              ==                                            ::
```

This space intentionally left undocumented. This stuff will change once
we get a well-typed clay.

#### `++upas`, tree change

```hoon
    ++  upas                                                ::  tree change (%d)
              $&  [p=upas q=upas]                           ::  cell
              $%  [%0 p=axis]                               ::  copy old
                  [%1 p=*]                                  ::  insert new
                  [%2 p=axis q=udon]                        ::  mutate!
              ==                                            ::
```

This space intentionally left undocumented. This stuff is not known to
work, and will likely change when we get a well-typed clay. Also, this
is not a complicated type; it is not difficult to work out the meaning.

#### `++nori:clay`, repository action

```hoon
    ++  nori                                                ::  repository action
              $%  [& q=soba]                                ::  delta
                  [| p=@tas]                                ::  label
              ==                                            ::
```

This describes a change that we are asking Clay to make to the desk.
There are two kinds of changes that may be made: we can modify files or
we can apply a label to a commit.

In the `|` case, we will simply label the current commit with the given
label. In the `&` case, we will apply the given changes.

#### `++soba:clay`, delta

```hoon
    ++  soba  ,[p=cart q=(list ,[p=path q=miso])]           ::  delta
```

This describes a set of changes to make to a desk. The `cart` is simply
a pair of the old hash and the new hash of the desk. The list is a list
of changes keyed by the file they're changing. Thus, the paths are paths
to files to be changed while `miso` is a description of the change
itself.

#### `++miso:clay`, ankh delta

```hoon
    ++  miso                                                ::  ankh delta
              $%  [%del p=*]                                ::  delete
                  [%ins p=*]                                ::  insert
                  [%mut p=udon]                             ::  mutate
              ==                                            ::
```

There are three kinds of changes that may be made to a node in a desk.
We can insert a file, in which case `p` is the contents of the new file.
We can delete a file, in which case `p` is the contents of the old file.
Finally, we can mutate that file, in which case the `udon` describes the
changes we are applying to the file.

#### `++mizu:clay`, merged state

```hoon
    ++  mizu  ,[p=@u q=(map ,@ud tako) r=rang]              ::  new state
```

This is the input to the `%merg` kiss, which allows us to perform a
merge. The `p` is the number of the new head commit. The `q` is a map
from numbers to commit hashes. This is all the new numbered commits that
are to be inserted. The keys to this should always be the numbers from
`let.dom` plus one to `p`, inclusive. The `r` is the maps of all the new
commits and data. Since these are merged into the current state, no old
commits or data need be here.

#### `++riff:clay`, request/desist

```hoon
    ++  riff  ,[p=desk q=(unit rave)]                       ::  request/desist
```

This represents a request for data about a particular desk. If `q`
contains a `rave`, then this opens a subscription to the desk for that
data. If `q` is null, then this tells Clay to cancel the subscription
along this duct.

#### `++riot:clay`, response

```hoon
    ++  riot  (unit rant)                                   ::  response/complete
```

A riot is a response to a subscription. If null, the subscription has
been completed, and no more responses will be sent. Otherwise, the
`rant` is the produced data.

#### `++rant:clay`, response data

```hoon
    ++  rant                                                ::  namespace binding
              $:  p=[p=care q=case r=@tas]                  ::  clade release book
                  q=path                                    ::  spur
                  r=*                                       ::  data
              ==                                            ::
```

This is the data at a particular node in the filesystem. `p.p` specifies
the type of data that was requested (and is produced). `q.p` gives the
specific version reported (since a range of versions may be requested in
a subscription). `r.p` is the desk. `q` is the path to the filesystem
node. `r` is the data itself (in the format specified by `p.p`).

### `++nako`, subscription response data

```hoon
    ++  nako  $:  gar=(map ,@ud tako)                       ::  new ids
                  let=@ud                                   ::  next id
                  lar=(set yaki)                            ::  new commits
                  bar=(set blob)                            ::  new content
              ==                                            ::
```

This is the data that is produced by a request for a range of revisions
of a desk. This allows us to easily keep track of a remote repository --
all the new information we need is contained in the `nako`.

`gar` is a map of the revisions in the range to the hash of the commit
at that revision. These hashes can be used with `hut:rang:clay` to find the
commit itself.

`let` is either the last revision number in the range or the most recent
revision number, whichever is smaller.

`lar` is the set of new commits, and `bar` is the set of new content.

## Public Interface

As with all vanes, there are exactly two ways to interact with clay.
`%clay` exports a namespace accessible through `.^`, which is described
above under `++care:clay`. The primary way of interacting with clay, though,
is by sending kisses and receiving gifts.

```hoon
    ++  gift                                                ::  out result <-$
              $%  [%ergo p=@p q=@tas r=@ud]                 ::  version update
                  [%note p=@tD q=tank]                      ::  debug message
                  [%writ p=riot]                            ::  response
              ==                                            ::
    ++  kiss                                                ::  in request ->$
              $%  [%info p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal edit
                  [%ingo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal noun edit
                  [%init p=@p]                              ::  report install
                  [%into p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external edit
                  [%invo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external noun edit
                  [%merg p=@p q=@tas r=mizu]                ::  internal change
                  [%wart p=sock q=@tas r=path s=*]          ::  network request
                  [%warp p=sock q=riff]                     ::  file request
              ==                                            ::
```

There are only a small number of possible kisses, so it behooves us to
describe each in detail.

```hoon
              $%  [%info p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal edit

                  [%into p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external edit
```

These two kisses are nearly identical. At a high level, they apply
changes to the filesystem. Whenever we add, remove, or edit a file, one
of these cards is sent. The `p` is the ship whose filesystem we're
trying to change, the `q` is the desk we're changing, and the `r` is the
request change. For the format of the requested change, see the
documentation for `++nori:clay` above.

When a file is changed in the unix filesystem, vere will send a `%into`
kiss. This tells Clay that the duct over which the kiss was sent is the
duct that unix is listening on for changes. From within Arvo, though, we
should never send a `%into` kiss. The `%info` kiss is exactly identical
except it does not reset the duct.

```hoon
                  [%ingo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  internal noun edit

                  [%invo p=@p q=@tas r=nori]                ::  external noun edit
```

These kisses are currently identical to `%info` and `%into`, though this
will not always be the case. The intent is for these kisses to allow
typed changes to Clay so that we may store typed data. This is currently
unimplemented.

```hoon
                  [%init p=@p]                              ::  report install
```

Init is called when a ship is started on our pier. This simply creates a
default `room` to go into our `raft`. Essentially, this initializes the
filesystem for a ship.

```hoon
                  [%merg p=@p q=@tas r=mizu]                ::  internal change
```

This is called to perform a merge. This is most visibly called by
:update to update the filesystem of the current ship to that of its
sein. The `p` and `q` are as in `%info`, and the `r` is the description
of the merge. See `++mizu:clay` above.

XX
`XX                [%wake ~]                                 ::  timer activate XX`
XX\
XX This card is sent by unix at the time specified by `++doze`. This
time is XX usually the closest time specified in a subscription request.
When `%wake` is XX called, we update our subscribers if there have been
any changes.

```hoon
                  [%wart p=sock q=@tas r=path s=*]          ::  network request
```

This is a request that has come across the network for a particular
file. When another ship asks for a file from us, that request comes to
us in the form of a `%wart` kiss. This is handled by trivially turning
it into a `%warp`.

```hoon
                  [%warp p=sock q=riff]                     ::  file request
```

This is a request for information about a particular desk. This is, in
its most general form, a subscription, though in many cases it is the
trivial case of a subscription -- a read. See `++riff:clay` for the format of
the request.
