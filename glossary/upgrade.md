An **upgrade proposal** is a type of [vote](../voting) action taken by the
[Galactic Senate](../senate) over [Azimuth](../azimuth). By passing an upgrade
proposal, [Galaxies](../galaxy) in the Senate agree to change the
[Ecliptic](../ecliptic) smart contracts.

An upgrade proposal is always a Yes/No vote on whether to adopt a particular set
of changes to the Ecliptic contracts. The vote concludes at the end of 30 days,
or whenever an absolute majority is reached, whichever comes first. At the end
of 30 days the option that has received the most votes is chosen. In either
case, the upgrade (or lack thereof) is performed automatically.
