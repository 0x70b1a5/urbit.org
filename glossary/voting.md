**Voting** is a power available to [galaxies](../galaxy), in their capacities as
members of the [Galactic Senate](../senate), through an [Azimuth](../azimuth)
smart contract. Galaxies collectively make decisions about the governance of
Azimuth and the [Arvo](../arvo) network by voting. There are two types of proposals that can be voted on:
an [upgrade proposal](../upgrade) and a [document proposal](../docvote).
