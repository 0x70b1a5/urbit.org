A **comet** is a kind of [ship](../ship) on the [Arvo](../arvo) network. They
are free identities for which we encourage new users to boot to try things out
before deciding to purchase a [planet](..planet).

Comets have nearly all the same capabilities as a planet. The exceptions are:
 - They may not spawn [moons](../moon).
 - They may not [change their networking keys](../bridge).
 - They must initiate all direct messages with other ships.
 
 The last limitation is technical and a workaround is slated. It also implies
 that comets may not initiate DM's with one another.

Comets have no presence on [Azimuth](../azimuth). Some groups on
[Landscape](../landscape) may not allow comet membership, but this is rare.
