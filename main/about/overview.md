        <div class="text">
            <p>Your files live on someone else’s server, your identity is owned by giant companies, privacy is a joke and your data has all been either hacked or sold to advertisers.  We live in 1995’s nightmare.</p>

            <p>Your Urbit is designed to store your data, run your apps and be your digital identity.   Each Urbit is a general-purpose computer on a global decentralized network.  Yes, really.</p>

            <p>If Bitcoin is money and Ether is law, Urbit is land.  Each Urbit is a piece of cryptographic property in a finite global namespace.  There’s no blockchain — Urbits are distributed in chunks.</p>

            <p>Today each of your services has to store both your data and identity and run some computation.  Want to leave a service?  Too bad.  Want to get your data out?  Good luck.  Your Urbit takes this entire layer and makes it yours.  Instead of living out of hotel rooms, you have a home.</p>

            <p>Urbit is a computing layer built for humans to own and operate individually.  Sort of like the internet in 1992, but built for 2050.</p>
            <p>We know how crazy this sounds — but that’s what makes it fun!</p>
