<h1>Urbit is designed to become your home in the cloud.<br/>Today it’s a working proof of concept.</h1>

        <h3>Lay the foundation</h3>
        <p>Urbit started as an independent PhD project in 2002.  In the past few years we’ve taken the project from a simple demo to a working proof of concept.</p>
        <p>2002 - 2008 — Nock virtual machine</p>
        <p>2008 - 2012 — Hoon programming language</p>
        <p>2012 - 2016 — Arvo opearting environment</p>

        <h3>Get to continuity</h3>
        <p>Urbit’s design is to create a single, uniform computing layer that can run on top of any unix box with an internet connection.</p>
        <p>Today the virtual machine is frozen, the programming language works well and the operating environment is still maturing.</p>
        <p>Our next major milestone is full network continuity.  With continuity we can get much closer to the fully self-updating platform Urbit is intended to be.</p>

        <h3>Connect to everything</h3>
        <p>You already have an Urbit — it’s just spread across all the services you use.  The first thing your Urbit should do is provide a clean and simple interface for all of today’s services.</p>
        <p>It should be simple to abstract away their differences so developers can build new things on top.</p>
