# We like to think freely and design from first-principles.

Urbit started out as an independent research project in 2002.  It wasn’t called Urbit back then, it was just a desire to reimagine how computers could be built.  Today we’re six people full-time in San Francisco. So

# In 2013 we started Tlon with the goal of delivering the first Urbit proof of concept.

Since the code is open source we wanted to make a clear distinction between Urbit the project and the company behind Urbit.  Tlon’s business is simple: at first we sell namespace and eventually hosting.  That’s it.  We can’t own you.  We can’t even own Urbit.  We just advance the platform.

Tlon owns about half of the Urbit namespace, and the Urbit foundation owns the other half.  A small portion has been given to early developers, supporters and investors.  The current state lives in the kernel, actually.  In `ames.hoon`. 

# Want to join us?  Send us a resume.  Or a portfolio.  Or a draft of your novel.
