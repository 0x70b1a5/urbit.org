## History

Curtis started working on Urbit in his garage in 2002.  By 2008 he'd
finished Nock, a productivity level of approximately 1 bit per day.
By 2012 Hoon was essentially in its present form.  By 2014, he had a 
prototype of Arvo, and used it to raise a little seed funding so we 
all could join him.

Urbit in early 2014 did most of the things it does today, but
badly.  For example, Urbit has chat and a shell now, and it had
both in 2014.  But in 2014, chat was built into the network
module and the shell was a kernel module.  Operating systems are
hard (but fun).

## Tlon

Urbit is open source (MIT license) and patent-free.

Tlon (named after a Borges story) is a vehicle for using the
potential value of the Urbit address space to make Urbit real.
Tlon owns about 40% of the address space (95 galaxies).

Another 50 galaxies are reserved for a future nonprofit.  Tlon's
long-term goal is to become a boring real-estate investment
trust, and shift development control to a Mozilla-style
foundation / community.  This will not happen any time soon.

## People

Some companies are all about cultural uniformity.  We couldn't
differ more.  No two people at Tlon see the world eye-to-eye.

Galen (CEO) is a surfer from Santa Cruz with an [architecture
degree](http://cooper.edu). Curtis (CTO) is a former CS grad student
who loves [old
books](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_True_History_of_the_American_Revolut.html?id=SZccAAAAMAAJ).
Anton is a rationalist Bolshevik and trained baritone.  Philip is
a home-schooled Christian and baseball fan.  Henry is a
prep-school soccer player and expert in horizontal marketing.
