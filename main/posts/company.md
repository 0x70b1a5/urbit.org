# Company + Team

## History

In 2002 Curtis went down to his garage with a question in mind: can
you build a computer whose state is just a number, and whose updates
are a single simple function?  In 2008 Nock worked pretty well, in
2012 Hoon compiled itself to Nock and in 2014 we raised a little
funding with the first prototype of Arvo.

## Tlon

Urbit is completely, 100% open source, and always will be.  We started
a company, Tlon, to support the development of the platform.  Tlon
owns roughly half of the Urbit address space, and operates with a
simple business model: use the value of Urbit address space to
bootstrap the development of the Urbit platform.  The name Tlon is a
reference to a Borges story.   

## Team

We’re a small team based in San Francisco that values open,
independent thinking and spirited debate.  We try to foster an
environment where thoughtful criticism can quickly turn into better
design and better code.  If you think you could be a good fit [send us
an email](urbit@urbit.org).
