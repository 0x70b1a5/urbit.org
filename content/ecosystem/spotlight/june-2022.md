Studio is an application from Tirrel Corporation which enables Urbit users to turn a Groups notebook into a public blog with just a few clicks. 

One can enable comments, multiple templates, and even integrate with Sendgrid to send new posts as email updates.

Tirrel has announced on their blog that Studio’s next release will include USD payments integration, allowing individuals to use Urbit to make a 
storefront and accept USD.

While most Urbit applications are focused on activity within the Urbit universe, Studio is unique in its focus on connecting the fiat and clearweb worlds to Urbit.

Check out more from Tirrel at tirrel.io and install Studio from ~tirrel/studio.
