Tirrel has announced on their blog that Studio’s next release will include USD payments integration, allowing individuals to use Urbit to make a 
storefront and accept USD.

While most Urbit applications are focused on activity within the Urbit universe, Studio is unique in its focus on connecting the fiat and clearweb worlds to Urbit.

description = "The Mars Review of Books is a magazine in print and on Urbit which combines ruthlessly intelligent and fearless sense-making on subjects of global importance with today’s most stylish belletristic writing on contemporary arts and culture."
content = """
Inspired by the early New York Review of Books, which was launched in protest against limp and toneless book reviewing in the Times Book Review, the MRB takes as its thesis that many topics and artistic productions which are important and stimulating to know about are ignored by today’s legacy publications. A new magazine that brings these topics to light will also create the conditions for the intellectual milieu that serious people and dedicated artists wish to see thrive.
