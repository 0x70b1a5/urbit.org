Groups is Tlon's flagship app: a community center, workspace, gallery, publisher, and messenger. Designed as a tool for collectives and organizations of various sizes on Urbit, Groups can host a company communication suite, a DAO, a blog, a music syndicate, and just about anything that involves collaboration, publication, or communication.

*Messages–send encrypted direct messages to one or many friends:*

Reach out to your friends directly via Messages, a simple chat tool that lets you talk one-on-one or with many.

*Notebooks–write and publish documents or blog posts:*

Write a blog post, create a magazine, draft an announcement or documentation using Notebooks, a short and long form text editor. You can add images, give other ships permission to comment on your posts, and mirror your content on the mainnet with ~tirrel's %studio app.

*Collections–maintain a mood board and gather links:*

Assemble a feed of images, save links for later, make a mood board, or start a forum on Collections, a repository for day-to-day digital trawling. 

*Profiles–personalize your Urbit ID:*

Make your Urbit ID yours: set a nickname, write a bio, change your avatar, or choose to stay anonymous. You can also pin featured groups on your profile. Hint: It’s a good way to share and discover new groups to join.
