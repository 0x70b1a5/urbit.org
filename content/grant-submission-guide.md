The Urbit project relies on our community to help realize its potential. While the Foundation specifies the direction of
development through bounties, we encourage anyone with an idea about how to improve Urbit to submit a grant proposal. This
guide will describe the different types of proposals, the requested format, and the entire workflow for a successful project.

### Types of Proposals

While we will entertain just about any idea that comes from the community, we are particularly interested in "capital goods":
projects that provide new capabilities to the widest number of users or developers or add tooling to the platform. Recent
examples are [Bitcoin](/grants/bitcoin-full-node-provider-and-wallet) integration, [WebRTC](/grants/webrtc-gall-agent-and-external-app)
integration, or the [Urbit Large File Storage](/grants/urbit-lfs-filehosting) project.

Proposal types include:

- Core Development - kernal or runtime development
- Application Development - userspace development of specific applications
- Developer Tools - Libraries, APIs, unit tests, etc.
- Design Work - design work for the urbit.org website
- Documentation - writing guides or website content
- Community - organizing events and meetups, staffing the help desk

We have need for lots of different skill sets&mdash;not just coding.

### Proposal Format

Your proposal should include the following sections:

- Project name
- Brief description of project
- Proposal body including:
  - Project Overview
  - Project Scope
  - Detailed behavior description
