One year ago, we started [integrating](https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-and-bitcoin/) Bitcoin into Urbit to be an OS-level primitive for money. Our initial goal: building a wallet equally sovereign and ergonomic. The first public version, releasing in Q1 2021, will have a broad set of capabilities including ship-to-ship payments, hardware wallet support, and full node integration. 

However, a wallet is only half the equation for a holistic P2P commercial experience. Offering goods and services is that other half. While we don’t part with our Bitcoin [easily](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/everyones-a-scammer/), two potential markets appear logical and attractive: content and Urbit-native services. 

First, a digital cottage industry (streaming, podcasting, newsletters, and other culture media) is currently blossoming. We think it can be even more vibrant if unshackled from centralized distribution platforms. Specifically, we’re building a peer-to-peer content graph which permits monetization. With a click, you should be able to syndicate your ‘thing’ to Urbit and get paid. 

Second, we enthusiastically note the proliferation of Urbit [providers](https://urbit.org/blog/providers/). Providers are businesses that offer a variety of Urbit-native services such as hosting, onboarding, Urbit IDs, and software distribution. A milestone in Urbit’s maturity will be when users can manage their provider relationships through Urbit itself. To get there, we envision a suite of basic commercial tools to assist providers in serving and scaling our network. 

Beyond these first use-cases, there is a blue ocean of opportunity. Extensibility means that every popular web 2.0 service can find its P2P analog on Urbit. We invite entrepreneurs of all stripes to join in the feeding frenzy. 

Throughout this project, Urbit Grants is your steadfast sponsor and resource. If you’re aching to work on any aspect of this, [send us a proposal](https://grants.urbit.org/create) and we’ll work with you to make it happen. We have recently posted [several](https://grants.urbit.org/bounties/2056919898-bitcoin-full-node-provider-and-wallet) [bounties](https://grants.urbit.org/bounties/794126751-bitcoin-key-derivation) to this effect; look out for more in the coming weeks.

These ideas are constantly nucleating in Urbitcoiners:
