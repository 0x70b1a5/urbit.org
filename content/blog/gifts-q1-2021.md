Twice a year we distribute address space to those that have made valuable contributions to Urbit. Pervious the rational and our thinking about the role of gifts can be seen in our previous gift announcements [here](https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-grants-and-mid-2019-gifts/) and [here](https://urbit.org/blog/gifts-q3-2020/). without further ado, here are the 2021 Q1 gift recipients (all to receive 1 star):
