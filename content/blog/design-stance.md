## Seasons

It’s early 2020, the transition between winter and spring, and Tlon’s interface group has concluded a series of projects that mark a transition point in Urbit (the project) itself. We’ve named the culmination of our efforts “OS 1,” as in “Operating System 1.”

For those who have yet to try it out, OS 1 is a bundling of “essential digital utilities” in the form of a 1) linear chat, a 2) long-form text editor and publishing/discussion medium, a 3) link bookmarking/discussion software, and most importantly, 4) a grouping mechanism that allows you to bundle the above services in the context of a group of friends, acquaintances, or family. We see these utilities as being archetypical “software shapes” that are inherently flexible and open for interpretation in terms of their use, but we have wild expectations for how these software shapes will evolve in the near future. Later design output and supplementary writing will expand upon what we mean by this.

Functionally, OS 1 has been designed to serve as a bridge between [Modulo](https://urbit.org/blog/landscape-a-portrait/) (Urbit’s first interface) and OS 2 (Urbit’s eventual departure from the web browser context). In its service as a “bridge”, we designed OS 1 to extend from the baseline app-like “module” experience first defined in Modulo, while granting it new affordances that gesture towards nascent conceptions of “communal computing” we have for OS 2 onward.

This year, as the warmer seasons give way to chillier ones, we plan on demonstrating much more regarding our vision of what new computers and networks can be. Until then we'll be building upon OS 1, our foundation and initial take on what we deem "user infrastructure".

## Products

Urbit’s interfaces, and the process by which we build them, are resolutely not projections of the world’s current conception of digital design — that of mass digital product design. Products are sold, bought, and discarded as they are in their physical sense. Digital products are slotted into the [vending machines](https://urcad.es/writing/personal-computer-vending-machine/) we call our phones and are mass produced as candy is produced. Candy is essentially free, and contemporary digital products are *absolutely* free of cost. If you’re reading this, you probably already have a good sense of what free corporate digital products entail for your privacy.

Urbit is *distinctly* not free, and your urbit is *distinctly* not a product. As we trace over the interfaces we design with our cursors, we’re not building a product, we’re not selling a product, we’re not painting a product, and we’re certainly not decorating a product.

Here at Tlon, we’re assembling thoughtful infrastructure you can spend your life using, learning, and extending. We’re attempting to assemble spaces you can one day pass on to friends, close collaborators, or possibly your grandchildren. We are resolute in our practice and stay our hands to the greatest degree possible as a result of this mindset.

## Beautiful Infrastructure

OS 1, while incremental in its initial expression from Modulo, serves to outline our sense of what beautiful (in the sense of sublime beauty), useful, and durable digital infrastructure should feel like to inhabit. For the purposes of OS 1, we can imagine “Beautiful Infrastructure” to form the spirit of what we’re building:

Beautiful infrastructure is inhabitable. You’re not floating in an infinite feed of content streams. You are situated in a defined space with edges you can shift at-will, as your needs deem fit. Our model for inhabitable computing is new, but our vision is long.

Beautiful infrastructure is a gravitational force. Even if you can’t feel it or directly experience it, well-designed infrastructure is a cohering force. One is grounded with respect to the infrastructure they live alongside.

Beautiful infrastructure is like a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell) I can pick. Well-considered infrastructural projects provide durable, generalized, and reusable containers around otherwise formless flows of information any other corpration would be incentivized to pump into your brain, aglorithmically-sorted-linear-feed style: In Urbit, I can take the conceptual container of "temporal linearity" and use this to shape communication data as I see fit. I should be able to shape once-linear communication and cast it into a nodal communication model: My DM is now a MUD.

Truly beautiful infrastructure undergirds the daily exchanges people actually care about; I don’t drink plumbing, I drink the water it carries and protects.

Another way of thinking about “Infrastructure” (here defined loosely as “the *truly* essential structures that allow society at varying scales to operate”) is to think about it in terms of interpersonal support structure. 

We deeply hope that Urbit can form a support structure for you and your peers.

These self-evident statements underlie the core problems we sought to address in designing a userspace for OS 1: How do we design an *actually* personal digital infrastructure? What does infrastructure look like when shared with immediate friends? With a cooperative organization? How can we impress upon Urbit's earliest adopters that once they've obtained an Urbit ID, their computer is at that moment *literally* entirely theirs?

## Expressing Infrastructure

OS 1 was optimized from an interface design standpoint to ensure that a new inhabitant viscerally felt like there was a “space to inhabit”, or a “canvas to be painted”, or a set of simple and fundamental digital structures they could arrange to make their computer their own. 

Counterintuitively, designing around this notion of a "rich blank slate” required OS 1 to be designed in a manner that *almost* resulted in it feeling incomplete, or on the verge of appearing deeply unremarkable. 

A few key design decisions emphasized the above gestalt:

1. We decided very early on to revert the colorful presentation of Modulo to a literal blank slate — OS 1 is much like a sheet of graph paper now.
2. All typography and typographic representation was severely flattened. This decision was one of our more drastic ones, and granted OS 1 a sense of being somewhat more "undirected". We hope that as our system becomes more robust, users can decide which elements of their systems require emphasizing, to feel most at home.
3. The majority of graphics used throughout the system were rendered back into black and white line drawings. In the sense of architectural or industrial design schematics and orthographic projection, we made the decision to assemble a foundation that felt more like a diagram than an ergonomic user interface.
4. A coupled notion of the above point is that we wanted to give our users the sense that modifying the underlying system was a simple task. Rather than present Urbit's first users with beautiful artistry and a sense that our infrastsructure was to remain untouched and sacred, we decided to present a visual face to the project that felt nearly rudimentary, nothing outside the realm of capability for a creative individual.

Many other small constraints have been set into place to build what we truly believe to be simple, durable, personal, digital infrastructure. 

While visually primitive, OS 1 has managed to convey a sense of rich systematic expressiveness based on how it seems to be currently inhabited. We've been enjoying witnessing the ways people are beginning to interpret and make use of the faculties provided to create communal computing experiences of their own.

What's most wonderful to observe is the fun people are having in striking out on their own in this collective endeavor. 

More than anything, we hope people are having a good time, and learning to enjoy computers again.
