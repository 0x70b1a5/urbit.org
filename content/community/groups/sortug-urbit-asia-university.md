We're building a place to learn about East and SE Asia on Urbit.  With aspirations to eventually expand all offerings, we begin with expertise in Chinese and Japanese.  ~mirtyl-wacdec will act as our headmaster, and all are welcome to join us learning languages and history and sharing culture and resources.  欢迎大家！
