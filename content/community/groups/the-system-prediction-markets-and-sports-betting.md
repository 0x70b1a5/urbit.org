**"The more money, the louder it talks." - Arnold Rothstein**

The System is a forum for discussing and creating prediction markets as well as various other types of gambling. The name refers to the search for the ideal system for betting/investing and The System of complex, interconnected market forces that controls everthing around us. Prediction markets have proven to be a surprisingly effective mechanism for harnassing these forces and helping investors, communities, and corporations make smarter decisions. Let's explore this world together and bend The System to our will (and perhaps make a buck in the process), shall we?
