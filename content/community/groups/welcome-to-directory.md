Directory is intended as a listing of public groups on Urbit. It replaces the old Bulletin Board in Urbit Community, which will shortly be phased out due to load-bearing issues. Since Urbit isn't centralized, Directory can't and won't be the only such listing place; let a thousand such cork-boards bloom! 

* Please make a new post for each group you're listing
* Please make the name of the group the title of the post
* If the group is public, please post the string so that others can join (such as `bollug-worlus/cycloids`)
* If the group is semi-public, please let people know who to DM for an invitation
