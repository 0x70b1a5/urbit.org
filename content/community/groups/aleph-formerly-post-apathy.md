Post Apathy has been restructured. It is now called Aleph. Our community now not only includes conversations on how to improve civilisation, but also channels dedicated to questions on Urbit's: governance, economics, marketing, and product design. 

Aleph wants to take a proactive approach to Urbit's development and we'll be discussing projects that we want to take on in regards to that in the near future.

You can find us at ~somheb-rigdux/post-apathy.
