Group to discuss the problem of finding meaning in the modern world. Probably starting with John Vervaeke's video lecture series on "Awakening from the Meaning Crisis".

"Do you ever awake at 3 am and think I’m just very complex pattern of atoms. That’s all. That’s really there. Everything else is just an illusion. And everything that I’m doing, I’m doing for things that aren’t real, for a self that isn’t real, in a universe that doesn’t give a damn about me, is completely indifferent. It’s not that it hates me. It’s completely inert and indifferent to me.”

-- Excerpt taken from Episode 20 of John Vervaeke’s lecture series “Awakening from the Meaning Crisis”.
