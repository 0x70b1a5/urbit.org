Welcoming all book lovers to urbit's premiere reading group.

Some key features of the group:

* **Best Book Lists**, a notebook for your humble (or not) opinions on the best books you have read.
* **Best Texts**, a notebook cataloging excellent subject-based texts and textbooks.
* The **Book Reviews** notebook is where you can contribute your reviews for the community. 
* We also now have a **Poetry** notebook where you can post your favorite or original poems and a **Lyrics** notebook for the musically inclined. 

This is a private group, so please DM ~winter-paches for an invite or comment below if DMs don't seem to be going through.

Thanks!
