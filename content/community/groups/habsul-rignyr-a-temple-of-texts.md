I'm forming this group to do a few things.

1. Learn the habitations of words and souls of sentences (etymology, usage, grammar, structure &c).
2. Vaunt the heroes of the language.
3. Create a space where it is not only acceptable but expected that one write effortfully, like the epistolary or longform of old and not like Twitter or sms (it is fine to write briefly, but try to do it well).
4. Pleasure in the aural and oral elements of the language again.

My hope is that we discuss words, sentences, sound, and soundly written passages and their writers.
