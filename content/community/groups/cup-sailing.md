From New York Yacht Club, a boat named America won the Queen's Cup away from the entire British Royal Yachting Squadron. It mirrored the way in which America (the state) was taking the mantle of naval/global supremacy. Since that first race in 1851 the boats they sail the race in have changed in ways that still mirror the spiritual evololution our economies/industries have gone through. At the moment, they're sailing the regatta for the 36th time in Auckland in these new concepts that have some very important aesthetic implications that can tell us a lot about our history, and probably our future. 

There's a little trailer, a collection of videos, and 3 articles so far. Hit the chat to ask questions about sailing, or daydream about what kind of boats they'll sail 170 years from now
