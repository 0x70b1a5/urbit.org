~darduc-mitfen/catholicism

This group is a place where we convene to discuss Catholicism, as well as other topics with the understanding that we are among fellow Catholics. We don't generally debate theology with non-Catholics and make a point to hold one another to correct moral theology in our discussions of topics that are not strictly about Catholicism. Some of these topics include homesteading, parallel polis social theory, and more. If you are Catholic or interested in learning more about Catholicism and what Catholics believe, please join us.
