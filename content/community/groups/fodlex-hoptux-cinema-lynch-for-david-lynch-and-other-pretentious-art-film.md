Any other Lynchmobbers here?

Join ~fodlex-hoptux/cinema-lynch

We will discuss all things Lynch and other pretentious art film that the unwashed masses of nacho eaters and Transformers watchers are unwilling and possibly constitutionally unable to appreciate, let alone understand.

Soliloquies, mental breakdowns, somnambulism, crying, and long autistic theories allowed and encouraged.
