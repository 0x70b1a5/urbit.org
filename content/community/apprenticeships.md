Apprenticeships pair a community member with an Urbit core developer. The apprentice works on a specific scope of work under the tutelage of the core developer. The developer offers guidance and review of the project, and the apprentice contributes directly to the Urbit project. The apprentice also receives compensation in the form of address space.

Apprenticeships are offered on a limited basis. Email [josh@urbit.org](mailto:josh@urbit.org) to register your interest.
