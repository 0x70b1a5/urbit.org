# Urbit is for communities

Whether your community is your family, your workplace, or another social circle, Urbit makes it easy to host a platform for discussion that can't be shut down or spied upon.

## Groups

Anyone can host a public group on Urbit. [Boot Urbit](/getting-started) or [click here](/community/groups) to browse public communities.

## Meetups

We meet up in real life to talk about Urbit and the future of computing. [Check out established meetups to find one near you.](/community/meetups/)

## Governance
