Come celebrate, friends! Urbit has had quite the decade, transforming from an intercepted interstellar transmission to a functional operating system, which also functions.

We're getting together to savor the moment and get hype about what the next decade holds (the whole replacing the internet thing).

We hope to see you there!

Things to bring:

-A friend

-A laptop, if you want help installing Urbit

-Good cheer
