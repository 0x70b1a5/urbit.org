<p>As usual, we're going to take a break and grab a beer.  Come join us!</p> <p>This time, Galen will give a short talk about designing the new Urbit prototype.  We'll spend some time answering questions, talking about design, interface and , and why general-purpose computing doesn't have to be scary.</p> <p>That, and just hanging out in the backyard.</p> <p>Feel free to bring friends!</p>
