Come grab a beer and enjoy the spring weather.  

We've got an OS to build, but we're going to open up the office doors for the evening to talk crypto, privacy and why the future might not be as scary as it seems.

Galen will give a short talk about designing the new Urbit prototype.  

Feel free to bring friends!
