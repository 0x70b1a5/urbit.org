<p>Turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun â€” so come hang out and have a beer (or wine).</p> <p>Ted will give a quick update on Urbit's new build system, ford. Then it's time to hang, listen to music (our friend Grayson will be playing records) and meet up IRL. The room is full of desks and the internet is pretty fast. Impromptu demos and tutorials are the norm. Bring your laptop and we'll install Urbit for you. Or just relax and talk to the weird array of people who also want to replace the internet.</p> <p>Feel free to bring friends!</p>
