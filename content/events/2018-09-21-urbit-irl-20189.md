Turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun â€” so come hang out and have a beer (or wine).

Gavin will give an update on Urbit design at 8:30. Then it's time to hang, listen to music and meet up IRL. The room has tables and the internet is pretty fast. Impromptu demos and tutorials are the norm. Bring your laptop and we'll install Urbit for you. Or just relax and talk to the weird array of people who also want to replace the internet.

Feel free to bring friends!
