<p>Urbit is a wilderness right now. A vast continent of possibility. We're gonna head out there and hack around. Join us.</p> <p>Before we go headlong into that unknown region, we're gonna have a party at basecamp (aka the office). Come hang out and have a drink with your fellow Urbit explorers.</p> <p>Bring your laptop if you want to install Urbit.</p> <p>And as always, drag a friend!</p>
