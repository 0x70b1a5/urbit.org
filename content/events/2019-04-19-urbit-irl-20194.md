Turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun â€” so come hang out and have a beer (or wine).

By popular demand: we'll try to keep this one QUIET so everybody can talk.

Come for a quick update on what we're working on. Stay to relax and talk to a weird array of people who also want to replace the internet.

Feel free to bring friends!
