Come, bring your laptop, and we'll get you started building things in Urbit's language â€” Hoon.

There's no lesson per-se, think of it more like an 'independent projects' class. A few of us will be around to help you get started working on whatever you're interested in. It's completely fine if you're new to the language. We're going to start with only 10 spots so we can help everyone individually.
