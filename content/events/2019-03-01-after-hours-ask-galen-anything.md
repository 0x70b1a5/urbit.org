We thought we'd try something new this month. Come hang out and ask Galen questions about Azimuth, Arvo, or any part of Urbit.

8:00-9:00pm: AMA

Afterwards, have a beer, connect with Urbit developers, fans, and friends IRL.

Feel free to bring friends and share the primer. <a href="https://urbit.org/primer" class="linkified">https://urbit.org/primer</a>
