description = "Same as usual: cold drinks in the backyard with the hoons.  Come meet other people crazy enough to want to replace the internet.  

Ted, the newest addition to our team, has been working on making changes to %arvo all over the place.  He'll give a short talk about some of his adventures in the Urbit OS and how they're going to make Urbit faster and easier to use.

That, and discussing why Equifax should have never been holding all that customer data in the first place.

Oh yeah, and we just got a fresh batch of Nock shirts!"
