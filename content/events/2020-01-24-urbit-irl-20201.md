"Neo-Urbit arrives from the future." It's 2020 and Urbit is accelerating. We've got a lot going live this year.

Replacing the internet is a thing to behold. Come by the offices to hang out, have a drink, and hear the latest.

Bring a laptop if you want help installing Urbit.

And as always, bring a friend!
