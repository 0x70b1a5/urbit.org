<p>We've been deep in the code, but it's always good to take a break. We're going to open the office doors for the evening to anyone interested.</p> <p>Come grab something to drink and hang out. We'll be here to talk about Urbit, the price of BTC, or how the waves were last week. Oh, and there will be a short talk on the new Urbit boot process.</p> <p>Bring your friends!</p>
