This time we'll be opening up the office, opening up a few cold ones, and talking about Urbit + Ethereum.

One thing that's been keeping us busy over the past month is designing the relationship between Urbit and the Ethereum blockchain.  We'll present our current design for this (from ~8:30 - 9) for people to comment on and ask questions about.

Otherwise, as usual, there will be plenty of time to hang out and chat with other Urbit people.  

The backyard is really nice in the evening!  Feel free to bring friends
