We had a busy and productive 2017. This time around, we're just going to play music and relax.

Come have a beer and connect with Urbit developers, fans and friends IRL. We'll be figuring out if 2018 is going to be the true peak crypto and why the FBI didn't just hodl the Silk Road coins.

Feel free to bring friends!
