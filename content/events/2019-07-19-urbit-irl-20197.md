description = "Turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun â€” so come hang out and chat with old and new friends over a beer.

Turning the music down has worked well, so we'll continue doing that. And if you want help installing Urbit, bring a laptop.

Feel free to bring friends!"
