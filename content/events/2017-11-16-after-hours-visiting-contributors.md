We've moved! Come check out our new digs, have a beer and hear about what people have been working on.Â 

This week we have ~mastyr-morzod, ~littel-ponnys and ~mastyr-harlud visiting the office. They've all been contributing great stuff from afar, so we figured out how to get them all in the same room to hack on Urbit for the week. On Thursday evening they'll talk about what they've been coming up with.

We'll also spend plenty of time just hanging around and talking about Parity, BCH, and everything else crypto-related. Feel free to bring friends!
