<p>Turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun â€” so come hang out and have some beer and pizza.</p> <p>This time we'll give a brief update on what we've been up to around 8pm. Turning the music down worked well, so we'll do that again. And if you want help installing Urbit, bring a laptop.</p> <p>Feel free to bring friends!</p>
