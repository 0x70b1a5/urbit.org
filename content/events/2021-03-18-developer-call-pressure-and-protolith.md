Landscape was an experiment. Now it’s Tlon's flagship client for the Urbit project: a product, a full-stack application, spread across a variety of Gall agents and libraries, lighting the way forward against the dwindling unknowns in the reality of Urbit userspace development and distribution.

Matilde Park, Landscape team lead, talks about the distinctions between the Landscape product and basic Urbit development, and the significance of building Landscape for Tlon — the role of “high-pressure experiments” in forcing our computer toward something rock-hard, diamond-perfect. With a few examples of ongoing deployments, she also outlines the problems being solved right now and the ones still a touch further out.

As usual, join us after the talk on the call to ask questions and hang out.
