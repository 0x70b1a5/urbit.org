description = "We're coming to Austin, TX! It turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun â€” so come hang out and have a drink on us. Feel free to bring friends and come early for Urbit shirts.

Thank you to our friends over at Garage for hosting us. We'll be there from 5-7 PM."
