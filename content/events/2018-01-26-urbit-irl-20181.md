<p>Happy New Year!</p> <p>Turns out that just getting Urbit fans in one room is pretty fun — so come join. No demos or talks this time. Just some time to hang, listen to music and meet up IRL. The room is full of desks and the internet is pretty fast. So impromptu demos and tutorials are the norm. Bring your laptop and we'll install Urbit for you.</p> <p>Feel free to bring friends!</p>
