This week Jake Miller (~littel-wolfer) will be giving us a look at his development process, walking through his "urbit-emacs" setup and how he uses org-mode and tmux for hoon development. He'll also be giving us a quick demo of his work-in-progress Roam importer.

Jake considers himself a recovering Fintech engineer currently working at Tlon. He is interested in building learning systems and tools in Urbit.

Please join us for Happy Hour after the talk to ensure all your burning yakshaving questions get answered.
