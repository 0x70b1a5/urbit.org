With the introduction of Layer 2 arrived a new set of Gall agents equipped with
an HTTP RPC API primarily intended for interacting with Bridge. We have
documented how to perform these API calls yourself if you are so inclined. These can be found [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16338962/Tzm3nx7x).

The set of API calls available is summarized in the following diagram.
