**Sail** and **Udon** are domain specific languages for Hoon.

Sail is used to express XML data structures, which are used for rendering
webpages. See the [Sail Guide](/docs/hoon/guides/sail) for more details.

Udon is similar to Markdown, a simple language for writing documents. Udon is stored in [Clay](/docs/glossary/clay) and rendered using [Ford](/docs/glossary/ford).
