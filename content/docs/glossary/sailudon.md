**Sail** and **Udon** are domain specific languages for Hoon.

Sail is used to express XML data structures, which are used for rendering webpages, such as when browsing [collections](/docs/glossary/collection) in [Landscape](/docs/glossary/landscape).

Udon is similar to Markdown, a simple language for writing documents. Udon is stored in [Clay](/docs/glossary/clay) and rendered using [Ford](/docs/glossary/ford).
