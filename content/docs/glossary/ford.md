**Ford** is the build-system [vane](/docs/glossary/vane). Ford is capable of sequencing generic asynchronous computations. Its uses include linking source files into programs, assembling live-updating websites, and performing file-type conversions.

Ford neither accepts Unix events nor produces Unix effects. It exists entirely for the benefit of [Arvo](/docs/glossary/arvo) applications and other vanes, specifically [Clay](/docs/glossary/clay) and [Gall](/docs/glossary/gall).

Ford is located at `/base/sys/vane/ford.hoon` within [Arvo](/docs/glossary/arvo).
