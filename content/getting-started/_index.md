## Introduction

Nothing about building a new OS from scratch has been easy. Or creating an identity system that adequately replaces the IP address.

Getting on Urbit isn't always easy, either. The onboarding process hasn't been optimized by product managers in search of maximal profit. There's no checkbox for your interests—you have to discover them yourself.

But we like to think this hard work is exactly what makes Urbit special. **Consider yourself warned.**

## Benefits

**As a user**, you can explore the people, community, and sheer novelty of the Urbit ecosystem while owning your entire experience. Your data, your messages, your apps.

**As a developer**, you can now build apps, a protocol for a whole suite of apps, or an entire online subculture, and distribute your work directly to your users' operating systems. No middlemen, no MEGACORPs, and no lock-in.

Someone once said, "All the smart people I know disappear into Urbit." If you're smart, you will too — not just installing and running Urbit, but taking the first step toward deploying your Final Computer.
