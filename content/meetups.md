Turns out that getting Urbit fans together in one room is pretty fun. Here's an incomplete list of community-led Urbit IRL groups. These events are generally informal and very approachable â€“ feel free to dive in. 

If you'd like to list your Urbit meetup or event on this page, send an email to [support@urbit.org](mailto:support@urbit.org).
