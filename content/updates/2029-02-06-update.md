It’s been quite a busy 2020 so far and we’ve got a lot going live this year — here’s some of the latest news from the Tlon team:

1. Last month’s updates to Arvo and Bridge included:
Fixes related to the network stability vote.
[Updates](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1996) to both Gall and Ames (our application sandbox and networking module, respectively).
[Support in Bridge](https://github.com/urbit/bridge/pull/335) for withdrawing stars from the linear release contracts.
 
2. Gavin wrote about how we created sigils, the visual representation of Urbit IDs. Read the post [here](https://urbit.org/blog/creating-sigils/). 

3. We’re pleased to announce the latest round of our semiannual gifts, which reward the hard work of contributors to the Urbit project from the last six months. To see all the contributions we’ve recognized, take a look at the [History](https://grants.urbit.org/history) section on the Grants website.

    - `~bannum-magtus` has been tireless in their efforts as a community Guide in the #ship-starting-support channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/C9ENTt3), and as an evangelizer.
    - `~nolmeg-hobdyn` could also be found nearly every day volunteering as a Guide in #ship-starting-support.
    - `~minder-folden` was a deep font of Urbit-related content, outreach, and support.
    - `~risruc-habteb` provided invaluable, consistent support in `urbit-help`.
    - `~rabsef-bicrym` for their efforts to teach Hoon to the community.
    - Pyry (`~dinleb-rambep`) [pkova](https://github.com/pkova) brought a steady stream of useful contributions to the [Urbit repository](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Apkova). 

4. Looking for a more formal way to contribute and get rewarded? Look for a [Bounty](https://grants.urbit.org/bounties) to claim, or pitch a [Proposal](https://grants.urbit.org/proposals) of your own. We’re always on the lookout for community members who distinguish themselves through their contributions. 

5. The next Dallas-Fort Worth meetup is on February 12, hosted by community member Reid. [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/Urbit-DFW/events/268194997/?rv=ea1_v2&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJGUwMGVjNGVmLTM3YTMtNDI1Yy05MDY1LTMyZGNiZjIxNDc2MA) to join.
 
6. The next SF meetup will be on February 28 at our offices. Join us!
 
7. Another meetup?
 
Talk to you soon!
