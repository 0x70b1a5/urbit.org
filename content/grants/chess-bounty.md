# Rationale
~finmep-lanteb is sponsoring the improvement of the Chess app to create a Chess experience comparable to that of any modern Chess website. The original development of Chess on urbit functions in the context of game logic and ability to play with friends, but lacks certain features, such as notifications of your opponent completing their turn, which are necessary to present a complete app experience. These quality of life improvements offer a great opportunity for a team of 3 novice Urbit developers (preferably three Hoon School Live and App School Live graduates) to work together to complete this bounty, each earning a star in the process.

The goals of the bounty are to resolve the many small quality of life issues currently present in the Chess app, as well as enable timed games and rated games.

# Deliverables
## Issue Handling
Resolve all of the currently open issues on the [Chess app GitHub page](https://github.com/ashelkovnykov/urbit-chess/issues). Prior to work starting, the grantee and champion will meet and mutually agree to a specific list of numbered issues will be included in the scope of this deliverable.

## Timing Server
Design and implement a timing server which can be operated by a third-party to play timed games. Ideally, this would be a generic timing server so that any future game could use it as a piece of infrastructure.

# ELO Rating Server
Design and implement an [ELO rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) server which can be operated by a third-party to track player skill ratings. Ideally, this would be a generic ELO server so that any future game could use it as a piece of infrastructure.


# Milestones and Compensation
Each of the three Deliverables above is a milestone. However, since the reward is 3 stars and designed to be completed by a 3-person team, it seems likely that the compensation schedule would be "1 star per person upon full completion".
